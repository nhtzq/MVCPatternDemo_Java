# MVCPatternDemo_Java
A simple MVC pattern demo with Student(model), StudentView(view) and StudentController(controller)

Student acts as the model class.

StudentView will be a view class which can print student details on console. 

StudentController is the controller class responsible to set or retrieve data in Student object and update StudentView object accordingly.

MVCPatternDemo, the demo class, will use StudentController to demonstrate use of MVC pattern.
